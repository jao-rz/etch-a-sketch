TO DO: 
-Make it so that modal can be hidden by 
clicking anywhere outside it.

-Make it so that when another icon is clicked,
the pencil icon is turned off.

-Make it so that when pencil is clicked, the 
border color changes instead of the backgroundColor.

-Add little pop up to Grayscale Icon on hover that says: Grayscale Pen

-design background (add color)

-Add every element on html via DOM

-Maybe move color picker modal to a different position

-Refactor color picker, grid and each icon's functions

-Make it so that user can change the size of the canvas.

-Add a pop up that asks user if they want to delete,
when they click on the delete icon.
