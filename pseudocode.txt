-Make it so that modal can be hidden by 
clicking anywhere outside it.
-Make it so that when another icon is clicked,
the pencil icon is turned off.

-Centralize canvas.
-create Pencil button besides selectedColorWindow
-Delete first buttons
-Add little pop up to Grayscale Icon on hover that says: Grayscale Pen
-design background (add color)


-Add every element on html via DOM
